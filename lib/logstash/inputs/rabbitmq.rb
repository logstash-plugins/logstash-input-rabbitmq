    # Pull events from a http://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] queue.
    #
    # The default settings will create an entirely transient queue and listen for all messages by default.
    # If you need durability or any other advanced settings, please set the appropriate options
    #
    # This plugin uses the http://rubymarchhare.info/[March Hare] library
    # for interacting with the RabbitMQ server. Most configuration options
    # map directly to standard RabbitMQ and AMQP concepts. The
    # https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html[AMQP 0-9-1 reference guide]
    # and other parts of the RabbitMQ documentation are useful for deeper
    # understanding.
    #
    # The properties of messages received will be stored in the
    # `[@metadata][rabbitmq_properties]` field if the `@metadata_enabled` setting is checked.
    # Note that storing metadata may degrade performance.
    # The following properties may be available (in most cases dependent on whether
    # they were set by the sender):
    #
    # * app-id
    # * cluster-id
    # * consumer-tag
    # * content-encoding
    # * content-type
    # * correlation-id
    # * delivery-mode
    # * exchange
    # * expiration
    # * message-id
    # * priority
    # * redeliver
    # * reply-to
    # * routing-key
    # * timestamp
    # * type
    # * user-id
    #
    # For example, to get the RabbitMQ message's timestamp property
    # into the Logstash event's `@timestamp` field, use the date
    # filter to parse the `[@metadata][rabbitmq_properties][timestamp]`
    # field:
    # [source,ruby]
    #     filter {
    #       if [@metadata][rabbitmq_properties][timestamp] {
    #         date {
    #           match => ["[@metadata][rabbitmq_properties][timestamp]", "UNIX"]
    #         }
    #       }
    #     }
    #
    # Additionally, any message headers will be saved in the
    # `[@metadata][rabbitmq_headers]` field.
